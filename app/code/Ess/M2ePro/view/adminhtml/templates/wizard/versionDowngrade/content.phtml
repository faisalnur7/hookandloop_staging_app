        <p>
            We detected a discrepancy between M2E Pro version stated in your database (setup_module table)
            and the actual version of M2E Pro files available in your filesystem. Most likely, M2E Pro files
            were attempted to get downgraded. To have the issue resolved, itâ€™s required to perform an extension upgrade.
            Please, follow <a href="<?php echo $url ?>" class="external-link" target="_blank">these instructions</a>
            to complete the upgrade.
        </p>
        <p>
            In case you are using any Version Control System (Git, etc), please remember to add the new version files
            to your system project after the upgrade.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the extension version is properly installed, reloading the page will get you out of maintenance mode.
